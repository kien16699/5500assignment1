# Preliminary Analysis

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(MASS)
```


```{r}
df <- read_csv("Inequality_data.csv")
```

```{r}
summary(df)
```

There are a few anomalies such as 2 NA values for all years from 1918 to 1958 with the exception of year 1948 having 20 NA values. Additionally the highest Gini index for the year 1968 is 1000, which is definite a mistake considering the range of Gini index value is between 0 and 1.

```{r}
df %>% pivot_longer(cols = -State, names_to = "year", values_to = "gini") %>% 
  filter(gini != 1000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = gini)) +
  geom_boxplot() 
```
